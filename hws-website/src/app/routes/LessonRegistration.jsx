                <h1>REFUND POLICY</h1>
                <h2>Cancellation and Refund Eligibility</h2>
                <h3>Cancellation by December 31st - No Questions Asked:</h3>
                <p>Customers can request a full cancellation of their lessons by December 31st, one month before the lessons' scheduled start date, without any questions asked. Full refunds will be provided for cancellations made within this period.</p>
                <h3>Injuries:</h3>
                <p>In the unfortunate event of a student sustaining an injury that prevents their continued participation in lessons, our refund procedure is as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the unfortunate event of a student sustaining an injury that prevents their continued participation in lessons, our refund procedure is as follows:</li>
                    <li>Injury After Lessons Start: If the injury occurs after the lessons have started, we will provide a refund for the missed classes later in the season, subtracting 20% from the total lesson price. This refund will require valid documentation as confirmation.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Absence from Lessons:</h2>
                <p>Please note that partial refunds may not be granted on a per-lesson basis for missed sessions. If a child is absent from a scheduled lesson without prior communication or cancellation, partial refunds will not be provided for the missed lesson.</p>
                <p>We strive to provide flexibility and fairness in our refund policies, but it's essential to adhere to the specific guidelines mentioned above for refund eligibility and exceptions. For any further clarification or assistance, please feel free to contact our lesson director, Phish Masteller.</p>

Therefore, refunds or compensation for changes in scheduling due to inclement weather are not guaranteed.</p>
                <h2>No-Show Policy:</h2>
                <p>To ensure the smooth operation of our skiing lessons and fairness to all participants, customers who fail to show up for their scheduled lesson dates without prior communication or cancellation will be considered absent, and will not be given a partial refund.</p>
                <h2>Exceptions & Discretion:</h2>
                <p>At our discretion, we may consider exceptions to our standard refund policies in certain circumstances.
