        <h2>EQUIPMENT AND LIFT TICKETS</h2>
        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <p>
            Before you head up to the mountain, please make sure you have all of the proper gear.
            This includes boots, bindings, skis or a snowboard, goggles or sunglasses, waterproof jacket, snow pants, and gloves.
            Be prepared for varying weather conditions and bring plenty of warm layers and a helmet.
            If you need to buy or rent equipment or clothing, check out some local shops or ski swaps!
        </p>
        <h3>LIFT TICKETS</h3>
        <p>
            The Summit at Snoqualmie offers passes for a variety of skill levels and for different age groups, and Husky Winter Sports cannot purchase and sell these to our students.
            Unless you already have a Season Pass, please check with your instructor before purchasing daily passes, as special cases exist.
            For example, never-ever lessons will most likely not ride the lift on their first weekend of instruction and will not need a pass;
            beginner lessons may wish to purchase a cheaper Beginner pass which allows them to ride on the Holiday and Gallery lifts only. 
        </p>

            <p>How do refunds work?</p>
            <p>Cancellation by December 31st - No Questions Asked. 
            Customers can request a full cancellation of their lessons by December 31st, one month before the lessons' scheduled start date, without any questions asked. Full refunds will be provided for cancellations made within this period.</p>
            <p>In the unfortunate event of a student sustaining an injury that prevents their continued participation in lessons, our refund procedure is as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In the unfortunate event of a student sustaining an injury that prevents their continued participation in lessons, our refund procedure is as follows:</li>
                <li>Injury After Lessons Start: If the injury occurs after the lessons have started, we will provide a refund for the missed classes later in the season, subtracting 20% from the total lesson price. This refund will require valid documentation as confirmation.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Please note that partial refunds may not be granted on a per-lesson basis for missed sessions. If a child is absent from a scheduled lesson without prior communication or cancellation, partial refunds will not be provided for the missed lesson.</p>
            <p>We strive to provide flexibility and fairness in our refund policies, but it's essential to adhere to the specific guidelines mentioned above for refund eligibility and exceptions. For any further clarification or assistance, please feel free to contact our lesson director, Phish Masteller.</p>
            <p>Contact huskywslessons@gmail.com and expect an email back within 5 business days.</p>
            <p>Inclement weather is an inherent risk we all accept when engaging in mountain activities. As such, we understand that adverse weather conditions may impact our operations, and everyone involved will be equally affected. Therefore, refunds or compensation for changes in scheduling due to inclement weather are not guaranteed.</p>
            <p>To ensure the smooth operation of our skiing lessons and fairness to all participants, customers who fail to show up for their scheduled lesson dates without prior communication or cancellation will be considered absent, and will not be given a partial refund.</p>
            <p>At our discretion, we may consider exceptions to our standard refund policies in certain circumstances. While we strive to maintain consistency in our policies for all customers, we understand that unique situations may arise. If you believe you have valid grounds for a refund or require special consideration due to extenuating circumstances, we encourage you to reach out to our lesson director, Phish <a href='mailto:huskywslessons@gmail.com'>(huskywslessons@gmail.com)</a>. Our team will carefully review your request and, where appropriate, exercise our discretion to assess the situation on a case-by-case basis. Please understand that granting an exception is not guaranteed and will be subject to our sole judgment. We are committed to ensuring customer satisfaction and will make every effort to address your concerns in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
            <p>Effective from August 2023, this policy supersedes all previous versions and governs all refund requests and related matters. Should the policy change, you will be notified via our mailing list.</p>

        <h3>LESSONS</h3>
        <div class="FAQ">
            <p>Why isn’t my child on the lift yet?</p>
            <p>
                Our instructors are trained to make sure that your child possesses the necessary skills before they are moved onto more challenging terrain.
                Younger children may need some time to get used to the snow before they can safely navigate the more advanced terrain served by the lifts.
                Snowboarding is trickier to start than skiing so your child may require some extra time to get used to sliding sideways.
            </p>
            <p>What should I do while my child is in lessons?</p>
            <p>
                Enjoy the 1,994 acres and lifts that Snoqualmie has to offer, grab a coffee or snack in the lodge, or take an adult lesson with us!
                While we know you want to see your children's progress first hand, it is easier for the instructors to teach when they have their students' full attention. 
            </p>
            <p>What can I work on with my child outside of lessons?</p>
            <p>
                If you ski or snowboard with your student outside of lessons, you can always ask their instructor for games that you could play to help the students improve.
                You can also always ask your child to show you the fun things that their instructor has taught them in lessons.
                Overall, the key is to keep them stoked to come up to the mountains!
            </p>
            <p>Why does my student keep switching lessons? I thought they would be with the same instructor?</p>
            <p>
                After the first week, we occasionally have to tweak lesson groups based on what we see on the hill.
                While we try to keep groups as consistent as possible,
                we think that it will help students get the most out of their lessons when they are learning with students at their same ability level.
            </p>
            <p>Why isn’t my child in the same lesson as their friends?</p>
            <p>
                We will do our best to group students with their friends if you request it when you sign them up.
                If we see that certain students have different needs in their lessons, we may separate them so that they can each get the most out of their lessons.
            </p>
            <p>Do I tip my instructor?</p>
            <p>
                All of our instructors are unpaid volunteers who spend hours training to teach the sports that they love - tips are not required, but greatly appreciated. 
            </p>
            <p>Can I reschedule a lesson?</p>
            <p>
                Get in touch with us!
                We will do our best to reschedule.
                But the earlier we know the easier it will be to find an alternative spot.
            </p>

        <h2>LOCATION</h2>
        <p>
            Lessons begin from the Ullr Snow Sports Meeting Area at Snoqualmie's “Summit Central.”
            To reach us, take Exit 53 from I-90 East and turn right at the stop sign.
            At the T-intersection, turn left, drive past the fire station, and turn into the large gravel parking lot on your left. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From the parking lot, walk up the switchback path towards the lodges.
            Looking towards the hill from the bonfire area, we are located outside the orange “Ullr” building south of the base of the Triple 60 Lift*
        </p>

        <p>
            *This can be a bit of a long walk for the young ones, so please make sure to arrive early enough to find parking in the Central lot (if full, you will be directed to an auxiliary lot and may need to take a shuttle back) and arrive at Ullr with plenty of time to get stoked and ready to go.
        </p>
