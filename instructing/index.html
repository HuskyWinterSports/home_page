        <h2>Become an Instructor</h2>
        <p>
            Husky Winter Sports wants to hire UW students to become new instructors for the 2011-2012 season!
            We want instructors who have a passion for skiing or snowboarding,
            who will join us on the slopes every weekend during winter quarter,
            and who want to have a great time.
            Not only will you be able to hit the slopes more than most of your friends,
            you will also meet a crew of dozens of friends who will show you the ropes of teaching,
            and join you on the slopes and in the park.
            Each weekend, we cruise up to the mountain on Friday evening or Saturday morning,
            ride like mad, and then chill at our cabin near the slopes of Snoqualmie Pass.
        </p>
        <p>
            We depend on our ski school instructors' reliability,
            so during the fall we want to see your commitment to the club.
            We select ski and snowboard instructors competitively,
            and we value prospective instructors who attend events, show enthusiasm, and actively advertise and recruit new students.
            If you are interested in becoming a ski and snowboard instructor,
            please participate in as many club activities as you can this fall.
            We love to have a good time, and we want you to join in!
        </p>
