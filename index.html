        <h1>Husky Winter Sports</h1>
        <p>
            Husky Winter Sports is a non-profit ski and snowboard school operating under Ullr Snow Sports at the Summit at Snoqualmie.
            HWS is run by the University of Washington's Husky Winter Sports Club, a registered student organization since 1937. 
            <!-- All instructors are student volunteers trained as snowsports instructors following national professional guidelines set by Professional Ski Instructors of America and the American Association of Snowboard Instructors. -->
            Ullr Inc. is PSIA member ski school and some members are working and training for certification.
        </p>
        <h2 id="about">About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Husky Winter Sports has been around since 1937, although it was a lot different back then, making it the oldest and raddest Registered Student Organization at the University of Washington.
            During the weekends of winter quarter, we run a ski school - Husky Winter Sports Ski and Snowboard School - located at the Summit at Snoqualmie ski area, about an hour away from campus.
            We want to spend our winter having fun and spreading stoke to people from all over the Seattle area through our ski and snowboard lessons.
            Our official mission is,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "Provide fun, safe, high quality and affordable mountain experiences to skiers and snowboarders of all ability levels, and to foster friendships among like-minded winter sports enthusiasts."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            As a club, we shred all winter long and try to take advantage of every snow related opportunity we can.
            As a ski school, we teach lessons each Saturday and Sunday of winter quarter. This boils down to 6 total weekends, with 2.5 hour lessons on both Saturday and Sunday.
            When we're not teaching lessons, we're shredding the slopes of Summit together as a club.
        </p>
        <h2><a href="instructing/">Become An Instructor</a></h2>
        <p>
            Husky Winter Sports offers a unique opportunity for UW students who are excited about snow sports and interested in sharing them with children and adults of all levels from the Northwest community.
            All members are trained as ski or snowboard instructors and receive a season's pass to the Summit at Snoqualmie in exchange for attending a minimum of two weekend-long training sessions and teaching for all our six lesson weekends.
