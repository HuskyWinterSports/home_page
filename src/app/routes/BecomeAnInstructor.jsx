                    <h2>WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO</h2>
                    <p>Husky Winter Sports is a student-run organization at the University of Washington that provides ski and snowboard lessons to students and the greater Seattle community. Our mission is to make winter sports accessible to everyone, regardless of their skill level or background.</p>
                    <p className='quote'>“Provide fun, safe, high quality and affordable mountain experiences to skiers and snowboarders of all ability levels, and to foster friendships among like-minded winter sports enthusiasts.”</p>
                    <p>As a club, we shred all winter long and try to take advantage of every snow related opportunity we can. As a ski school, we teach lessons each Saturday and Sunday of winter quarter. This boils down to 6 total weekends, with 2.5 hour lessons on both Saturday and Sunday. When we're not teaching lessons, we're shredding the slopes of Summit together as a club.</p>
